|Workload is spread over the whole team | 3 |[Contributor stats](https://github.com/smanishs175/WalletBuddy/graphs/contributors) |
|Number of commits|3| 78 [Commits](https://github.com/smanishs175/WalletBuddy/graphs/commit-activity) The numbers might seem different it cause everyone created seperate branches and committed and after merging the numbers are different. Everybody worked equally. |

|Docs: why: docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing| 1 | The docs tell the workings|
|Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code.|3 |  Video explains the workings and keeps scope of expansion|
